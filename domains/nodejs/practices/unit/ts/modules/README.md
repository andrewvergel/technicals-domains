Explanation:

•	Modules: TypeScript allows splitting code into reusable modules. mathModule.ts exports functions that main.ts imports and uses.

•	NPM: Node Package Manager (NPM) is used to manage dependencies. You can install external packages with npm install <package-name> and import them similarly.
