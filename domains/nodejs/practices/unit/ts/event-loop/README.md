# Explanation

The event loop in Node.js first executes synchronous code, and then it processes callbacks in the event queue (in this case, from setTimeout).

case1 :
• Synchronous Code: Runs first, so "Start" and "End" are logged immediately.
• Event Queue: After the synchronous code finishes, the event loop processes tasks in the event queue. The setTimeout callbacks are executed in the order they were added, logging "Timeout 1" and then "Timeout 2". 

case2 : 
Event Loop: Node.js handles asynchronous operations using the event loop. The code executes synchronously first (Start, End), then microtasks (like resolved Promises), and finally tasks from the callback queue (like setTimeout).
