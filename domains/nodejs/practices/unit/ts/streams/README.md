# Explanation

•	Streams: Streams are used for reading or writing data in chunks, which is efficient for large files. The code reads data from input.txt in chunks and writes it to output.txt.

•	Buffers: Chunks are stored in buffers, temporary storage that handles binary data. This allows for processing data without loading the entire file into memory.
